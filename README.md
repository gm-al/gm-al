### Hi ðŸ‘‹

- My name is Gani, I'm a passionate dev. Love working on things that have meaning. I studied physics mainly because I loved it.
  Now, coding and building software. Facts: The first programming language I learned was C# and it was a suggestion from a friend.
- Check out my [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/ganiatp) planning to stream and share my experience on building new things with Go, and Rust.
- Building [Impfiy.io](https://github.com/Impfiy) with some cool projects. BTW, I use Vim.
  
âš¡ Fun fact: I play [Apex Legends](https://twitter.com/PlayApex) for fun.


This is my [twitter](https://twitter.com/gani_atp) just in case you overlooked it :D

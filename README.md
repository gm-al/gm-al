### Hey! I'm Gani ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a passionate dev, who loves working on OSS and playing with code.
- The first programming language I learned was C# and it was a suggestion from a friend.
  
âš¡ Fun fact: I play [Apex Legends](https://twitter.com/PlayApex) for fun.


This is my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dxrgani) in case you overlooked it :D
